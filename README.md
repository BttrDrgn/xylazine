# Xylazine
Xylazine is a reimplementation project for Need for Speed: Underground 2 which aims to logically match, not bytecode match, the inner workings of the Speed engine, EA Graphics Library, Realcore, and most importantly, the game's logic.

# Progress
In the current state of the project, progress cannot be fully realized by garunteed data. The current estimate is 15,000 functions as recognized by IDA Pro's subroutine checks.  
Progress can be checked by running the `progcalc.bat` in the root of the directory.

# Installing
Xylazine is not yet ready for public use. While it does technically run the game almost identically to the retail PC release, there is no point in a release binary. However, if you still wish to use Xylazine, you can find pre-built debug binaries in the [build actions](//github.com/BttrDrgn/xylazine/actions/workflows/build.yml) section of the repository.
